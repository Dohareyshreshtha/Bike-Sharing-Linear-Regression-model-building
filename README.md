# BoomBikes Demand Prediction

## Project Overview

BoomBikes, a leading bike-sharing provider in the US, has faced significant revenue challenges due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The company seeks to develop a strategic business plan to boost revenue as lockdowns lift and the economy recovers. This project aims to understand the factors influencing the demand for shared bikes post-pandemic by building a linear regression model.

## Goals

1. **Predict Bike Demand**: Develop a linear model to predict the demand for shared bikes after the quarantine ends.
2. **Identify Significant Variables**: Determine which variables significantly affect bike demand.
3. **Model Accuracy**: Assess the accuracy of the model in predicting bike demand.

## Data Insights

- **Seasonal Trends**:
  - **Spring**: Lower bike usage as people tend to avoid riding.
  - **Summer and Fall**: Higher demand, with a preference for bike riding during these seasons.
  - **Winter**: Moderate demand, with some positive influence on bike usage.

- **Yearly Trends**:
  - Demand in **2019** showed an increase compared to **2018**.

- **Weather Impact**:
  - **Clear Weather**: High demand for bike sharing.
  - **Light Snow or Mist**: Lower demand, as adverse weather conditions discourage biking.

- **Monthly Trends**:
  - Highest demand is observed from **May** to **September**.

- **Holiday Trends**:
  - Slightly lower demand on holidays compared to non-holidays.

- **Key Relationships**:
  - **Positive Correlation**: Temperature, summer and winter seasons, year 2019, September month.
  - **Negative Correlation**: Windspeed, spring season, holidays, light snow or mist weather conditions.

## Recommendations

1. **Focus on High-Demand Months**: The company should prioritize the months of **May**, **June**, **July**, **August**, and **September** due to higher demand during this period.
2. **Weather Monitoring**: Since demand increases with temperature, itâ€™s crucial to keep track of weather conditions and adjust operations accordingly.
3. **Fall Season Preparation**: As demand rises in the fall, BoomBikes should ensure they are well-prepared to meet this increased demand.
4. **Holiday Promotions**: Since biking is less popular during holidays, introducing attractive offers during these times could help maintain customer interest.
