BoomBikes Demand Prediction
Project Overview
BoomBikes, a leading bike-sharing provider in the US, has faced significant revenue challenges due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The company seeks to develop a strategic business plan to boost revenue as lockdowns lift and the economy recovers. This project aims to understand the factors influencing the demand for shared bikes post-pandemic by building a linear regression model.

Goals
Predict Bike Demand: Develop a linear model to predict the demand for shared bikes after the quarantine ends.
Identify Significant Variables: Determine which variables significantly affect bike demand.
Model Accuracy: Assess the accuracy of the model in predicting bike demand.
Data Insights
Seasonal Trends:

Spring: Lower bike usage as people tend to avoid riding.
Summer and Fall: Higher demand, with a preference for bike riding during these seasons.
Winter: Moderate demand, with some positive influence on bike usage.
Yearly Trends:

Demand in 2019 showed an increase compared to 2018.
Weather Impact:

Clear Weather: High demand for bike sharing.
Light Snow or Mist: Lower demand, as adverse weather conditions discourage biking.
Monthly Trends:

Highest demand is observed from May to September.
Holiday Trends:

Slightly lower demand on holidays compared to non-holidays.
Key Relationships:

Positive Correlation: Temperature, summer and winter seasons, year 2019, September month.
Negative Correlation: Windspeed, spring season, holidays, light snow or mist weather conditions.
Recommendations
Focus on High-Demand Months: The company should prioritize the months of May, June, July, August, and September due to higher demand during this period.
Weather Monitoring: Since demand increases with temperature, itâ€™s crucial to keep track of weather conditions and adjust operations accordingly.
Fall Season Preparation: As demand rises in the fall, BoomBikes should ensure they are well-prepared to meet this increased demand.
Holiday Promotions: Since biking is less popular during holidays, introducing attractive offers during these times could help maintain customer interest
